* Phthalic anhydride is an important chemical intermediate in the plastics industry from which are derived numerous phthalate esters that function as plasticizers in synthetic resins. Phthalic anhydride itself is used as a monomer for synthetic resins such as glyptal, the alkyd resins, and the polyester resins. Phthalic anhydride is used in the synthesis of primary amines, the agricultural fungicide phaltan, and thalidomide. Other reactions with phthalic anhydride yield phenolphthalein, benzoic acid, phthalylsulfathiazole (an intestinal antimicrobial agent), and orthophthalic acid.  
* Chemical intermediate for various chemical resins, dyes, and pigments; curing agent for epoxy resins; \[HSDB\] Occupational asthma reported in plastic resin production workers; \[Malo\] Used to make alkyd resins in the production of paints; Workers may be exposed while welding on painted metals containing alkyd resin with phthalic anhydride hardener\[HSDB\]

* Scorch inhibitor for rubber stocks.

Methods of Manufacturing

* Prepared from naphthalene by oxidation with a mixture of HgSO4 and CuSO4 in presence of H2SO4; by passing naphthalene and oxygen over a suitable catalyst at 400-500 °C.  
* /Commercial production by/ ... gas-phase oxidation of naphthalene or o-xylene in an air stream with vanadium oxide as catalyst.
