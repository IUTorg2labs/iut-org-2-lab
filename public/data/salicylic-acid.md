* Source: bark of the white willow and wintergreen leaves; also produced by organic synthesis; Used medicinally for its bacteriostatic, fungicidal, and keratolytic properties; the salts are used as analgesics (aspirin)  
* Salicylic acid is used mainly in the synthesis of acetylsalicylic acid, the most commonly dispensed pharmaceutical product. In the form of esters, amides, and salicylic acid salts it serves as a starting material for other pharmaceutical products. Technical-grade salicylic acid is used primarily as an intermediate in the production of agrochemical products, dyes, and colorants, as well as in the rubber industry and in the manufacture of phenolic resins.  
* In the manufacture of aspirin, methyl salicylate, and other salicylates. Coupling agent for azo dyes. Has been used as food preservative. Keratolytic. Sodium salt as anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic.  
* Manufacture of resins, prevulcanization inhibitor, analytical reagent, /formerly as a/ fungicide  
* Acanthosis nigricans can be dealt with by using lotions or creams containing salicylic acid  
* Key additive in many skin-care products for the treatment of acne, psoriasis, callouses, corns, keratosis pilaris and warts.  
* Acanthosis nigricans can be dealt with by using lotions or creams containing salicylic acid  
* Methods of Manufacturing  
* Salicylic acid is prepared on an industrial scale by the Kolbe-Schmitt synthesis from dry sodium phenoxide in a stream of carbon dioxide at 150-160 °C and a pressure of 5 bar. The use of pressure results in a yield of about 90%, whereas without pressure the yield does not exceed 50% because disodium salicylate and phenol are formed in equivalent amounts.  
* Technical-grade salicylic acid obtained from the Kolbe-Schmitt process is already extremely pure: salicylic acid content 99.5%; phenol, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, or 4-hydroxyisophthalic acid 0.05 \- 0.1% (as impurity); ash \< 0.1%; water 0.2%. An even higher quality acid (pharmaceutical grade) can be obtained by crystallizing the sodium salicylate from water at a temperature not exceeding 20 °C, or by sublimation of the acid at 20 mbar and a temperature of 154 °C or with the aid of a carrier gas. A more modern process achieves sublimation directly by utilizing the heat of neutralization from the reaction of sodium salicylate with hydrogen chloride.  
* REACTION OF DRY, POWDERED SODIUM PHENATE WITH EXCESS CARBON DIOXIDE TO PRODUCE SODIUM SALICYLATE SOLUTION, WHICH IS ACIDIFIED TO OBTAIN SALICYLIC ACID  
* Manufactured by heating sodium phenolate with carbon dioxide under pressure.  
* SOME IS  MADE BY SAPONIFYING CERTAIN NATURAL OILS SUCH AS BIRCH OR GAULTHERIA.
