* Used as a laboratory reagent in chemical and biochemical analysis, in field testing of lead fumes, vinyl chloride determination, uric acid in urine, aniline vapors, and separation of gases. Used in miscellaneous applications for etching compounds for engraving; deliming agent during leather tanning, solvent for organic compounds, and oil well acidizer.  
* Used in chemical industry ... as an acidifying and neutralizing agent. Used in canning industries as an additive or flavorant for pickles, fish, meat, candy, and glazes ... used in textile and dye industries as ... dye catalysts, textile finishing, dye after-treatment, and production of nylon and acrylic fibers.  
* Constituent of photographic fixing baths, hardeners, hypotest solutions, and constituent of microfilm cements.  
* Acetic acid gives vinegar its sour taste and pungent smell. It is an important chemical reagent and industrial chemical, used in the plastic, pharmaceutical, dye, insecticide, textile, rubber, and photographic industries. Water-free acetic acid (glacial acetic acid) is used in the production of certain fragrances. (L1885) Used to treat infections in the ear canal.  
  Methods of Manufacturing  
* The major routes for synthetic acetic acid include methanol carbonylation, acetaldehyde oxidation, butane/naphtha oxidation, and methyl acetate carbonylation. Comparatively small amounts are generated by butane liquid-phase oxidation, direct ethanol oxidation, and synthesis gas.  
* Obtained in the destructive distillation of wood; from acetylene and water, via acetaldehyde by oxidation with air.  
* Liquid- and vapor-phase oxidation of petroleum gases (with catalyst); ... oxidation of acetaldehyde; ... reaction of methanol and carbon monoxide (with catalyst; this is the most cost efficient method and has been in general use for some years); ... fermentative oxidation of ethanol.  
* Acetaldehyde (air oxidation): acetaldehyde + oxygen (Hoechst-Shawinigan process; coproduced with acetic anhydride): acetaldehyde (air oxidation; coproduced with peracetic acid): methanol + carbon monoxide (BASF/Monsanto carbonylation processes): methanol + carbon monoxide (BP acetyls process; coproduced with acetic anhydride): naphtha, heavy (liquid-phase oxidation; coproduced with acetone/methyl ethyl ketone/formic acid/propionic acid): n-butane (Celanese LPO process; coproduced with methanol/ethanol/acetone/methyl ethyl ketone/formic acid/propionic acid/n-butyric acid/methyl formate): acetic anhydride + cotton linters/bleached wood pulp (acetylation/partial hydrolysis; byproduct of cellulose acetate production)
