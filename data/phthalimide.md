Phthalimide

### It is solid in nature and white in colour.
### The molar mass of the compound is 147.33 g/mol.
### Phthalimide melting point is 238℃ and the boiling point is 336℃.
### It is acidic in nature with a pKa value of 8.3.
### It is resonance stabilized.
### It is an imide derivative and has a heteroatom present in it.
### When it is reacted with base, it results in the formation of salts.
### The reason for high acidity is the presence of two electrophilic carbonyl groups.
