Methods of Manufacturing

* FROM LIGHT PETROLEUM BY FRACTIONAL DISTILLATION, DEHYDRATION OF PENTANE FRACTION WHICH IS THEN HEATED & RE-FRACTIONATED, & AMYLCHLORIDE FRACTION AGAIN FRACTIONALLY DISTILLED, GIVING MONO-CHLORO-PENTANE MIXTURE. THIS IS SUBJECTED TO HYDROLYSIS WITH SODIUM OLEATE SOLN IN PRESENCE OF CATALYST.  
* BY FRACTIONATION OF FUSEL OIL & VIA CHLORINATION OF PENTANES  
* FROM BUTADIENE, CARBON MONOXIDE, WATER, PLUS CATALYST; FROM METHYLBUTENES
