* Home maintenance \-\> degreaser

Category Description: Products for removing grease and other hydrophobic materials from hard surfaces

* flavoring

* fragrance component

* Used in the production of nylon, paints, plastics, detergents, textiles, and pesticides  
* Solvent for alkyd resins, alcohol-soluble phenolic resins, ethyl cellulose. Manufacture of celluloid; finishing textiles; in insecticides.  
* Oxidation of cyclohexanol to adipic acid is the most important use... 90% of adipic acid produced in the United States is used in the manufacture of nylon-6,6... The next important usage of cyclohexanol, pure or admixed with cyclohexanone as KA-oil, is in the production of caprolactam, which is used in the manufacture of nylon-6 polymer.  
* Chemical intermediate; a stabilizer and homogenizer for soaps and synthetic detergent emulsions; solvent for lacquers and varnishes.

  Methods of Manufacturing


* Cyclohexanol can be prepared in high yield by either vapor- or liquid-phase hydrogenation of phenol. Vapor-phase hydrogenation can be carried out by using a supported nickel catalyst or a nickel catalyst containing copper, cobalt, or manganese. The support is usually alumina or silicic acid. Yields as high as 98% have been reported. ... Commercial liquid-phase hydrogenation of phenol under mild conditions with a palladium on carbon catalyst gives greater than 99% yield of cyclohexanone at 90% conversion. By adjusting the operating conditions and changing to a Raney nickel catalyst, 99.9% selectivity for cyclohexanol can be achieved.

* Boric acid modified oxidation of cyclohexane ... In the 1950s, Scientific Design (now Halcon International) developed a process in which anhydrous metaboric acid was added as a slurry to the first of several staged air oxidation vessels. The cyclohexyl hydroperoxide formed is trapped as the cyclohexyl perborate ester. The perborate ester then reacts with additional cyclohexane in the air oxidizer to yield the borate ester and additional cyclohexanol. This borate ester is relatively stable in the air oxidizer and is protected from over oxidation to ring-opened products. The ester is subsequently hydrolyzed to cyclohexanol and boric acid. The boric acid is dehydrated to metaboric acid and is recycled to the air oxidizer.  
    
    
* Production and hydration of cyclohexene ... The process involves three primary steps: the selective hydrogenation of benzene; the separation of the cyclohexene from the unconverted benzene and the over-hydrogenation product cyclohexane; and the hydration of the cyclohexene. The yield of this process from benzene to cyclohexanol is extremely high, probably greater than 95%.
