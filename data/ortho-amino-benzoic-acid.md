* As mold inhibitor in soya sauce; its esters have found applications in perfumes, synthetic flavors, bird and insect repellents, as fungicides for syrups  
* THERAP CAT (VET): The cadmium salt has been used as an acaricide in swine  
* Enhances the milk production in cows. ... Intermediate for dyes. ... Intermediate for tranquilizers and antiphlogistics.  
* Naturally produced by the body (endogenous).  
  Methods of Manufacturing  
* prepared by fischer in 1896 by heating 2-nitrosobenzoic acid with aq ammonium sulfide @ 100 °c...produced commercially by hofmann reaction, in which phthalimide is reacted with sodium hypochlorite & caustic soda...  
* prepared by reduction of o-nitrobenzoic acid  
* treatment of phthalimide with an alkaline hypobromite soln.  
* 2-Aminobenzoic acid is usually made from phthalic anhydride via sodium phthalamate. Oxidative decarboxylation (the Hofmann reaction) is carried out by the addition of sodium hypochlorite solution at 60 \- 100 °C followed by acidification. The product is purified with activated carbon and bisulfite.
