* Used to make nylon, polyurethane foams, lubricants, and plasticizers; Used in adhesives, baking powder, and food flavoring  
* The major markets for adipic acid include use as feedstocks for nylon 6,6 resins and fibers, polyester polyols and plasticzers.  
* Applications documented for adipic acid are as a lubricant additive in coatings, and foams, and in shoe soles, as tanning agent in leather industry, pH regulator in processes such as in the production of cleaning agents, pelletizing agent in disinfectant pills for drinking water, additive in flue gas sulfurization, in the coating of dishwashing machine tablets and as an additive in chemicals  
* As an acidulant in dry powdered food mixtures, especially in those products having delicate flavors & where addition of a tang to the flavor is undesirable.  
* addition to foods imparts a smooth, tart taste. In grape-flavored products, it adds a lingering supplementary flavor and gives an excellent set to food powders containing gelatin ... For concentrations /of adipic acid ranging/ from 0.5-2.4 g/100 mL, the pH ... varies less than half a unit. ... pH is low enough to inhibit browning of most fruits and other foodstuffs.

## Methods of Manufacturing

* Commercially important processes ... employ two major reaction stages. The first reaction stage is the production of the intermediates cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol, usually abbreviated as KA, KA oil, ol-one, or anone-anol. The KA (ketone, alcohol), after separation from unreacted cyclohexane (which is recycled) and reaction by-products, is then converted to adipic acid by oxidation with nitric acid.  
* Two companies Verdezyne and Rennovia are developing bio-based adipic acid production. Verdezyne uses genetically modified enzymes to ferment glucose to adipic acid. ... Rennovia uses air oxidation to convert glucose to glucaric acid, followed by hydrodeoxygenation to convert glucaric acid to adipic acid.  
* Oxidation of cyclohexane, cyclohexanol, or cyclohexanone with air or nitric acid.
