* Virtually all aspirin is used in pharmaceutical products in aspirin tablets or in concert with other ingredients  
* for use in the temporary relief of various forms of pain, inflammation associated with various conditions (including rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, osteoarthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis), and is also used to reduce the risk of death and/or nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with a previous infarction or unstable angina pectoris.  
* Animal Drugs \-\> FDA Approved Animal Drug Products (Green Book) \-\> Active Ingredients  
* Aspirin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory over-the-counter drug. Aspirin relieves pain and reduces fever. Aspirin prevents blood from clotting quickly. Aspirin is added to cosmetics in order to reduce irritation and inflammation.  
    
* Potential health impacts: The major routes of exposure to aspirin in cosmetics are through the skin or by ingestion. Some people are sensitive to aspirin and can have severe reactions to small amounts. In high doses, aspirin can affect the liver. Aspirin is not recommended for children because of a link to Reye Syndrome, a serious liver disease. Aspirin is generally not recommended for use as a pain reliever during pregnancy, because it can cause changes in the heart of the unborn child and may delay or prolong labor. It also increases the risk of bleeding.  
    
* The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies aspirin as FDA Pregnancy Category D; there is a known risk to the fetus when the drug is used during pregnancy, but potential benefits may sometimes outweigh the risk. California Proposition 65 lists aspirin as a chemical known to cause developmental effects and reproductive harm.  
    
* Methods of Manufacturing  
* Acetylsalicylic acid is prepared by reacting acetic anhydride with salicylic acid at a temperature of \<90 °C either in a solvent (e.g., acetic acid or aromatic, acyclic, or chlorinated hydrocarbons) or by the addition of catalysts such as acids or tertiary amines.  
* Impurities  
* 4-hydroxybenzoic acid; 4-hydroxybenzene-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (4-hydroxyisophthalic acid); salicylic acid; 2-\[\[2-(acetyloxy)benzoyl\]oxy\]benzoic acid (acetylsalicylsalicylic acid); 2-\[(2-hydroxybenzoyl)oxy\]benzoic acid (salicylsalicylic acid); 2-(acetyloxy)benzoic anhydride (acetylsalicylic anhydride)
